### Enron Dataset Intent Detection

Forked from https://github.com/gauravshegokar/enron-dataset-intent-detection

Go through .ipynb files in order to run the solutions. All model wheights are provided, but you may want to download Glove in order to launch the third solution.

The max accuracy I got in the third solution is 84.8%
